    App Description: Briefly explain – in  your own words - what the app does. Describe the purpose of each activity and how they work together.

    This application allows a user to add passengers or users to a roster, which can later be retrieved. It is meant to be used
    with an airline. There are 2 parts to the app, one creates and populates the roster, while the other retrieves.
    There is also some code to handle user interaction with the app, as well as some simple life cycle stuff.



    Challenges and Solutions: Share any obstacles you encountered while building your app – one or two will do. How did you solve these issues?

    I had a lot of trouble with the layout and dependencies, and I had to use a linear layout,
    despite wanting to use a different layout entirely. Otherwise, I found it a bit trivial.
    I wish we could have designed our own apps that followed some basic guidelines. I guess
    a challenge for me was that I found it very tedious to follow such an explicit guide.


    Key Learnings: Reflect on what you learned about Kotlin programming, XML layouts, and passing data between activities.

    This was a great learning opportunity despite my grievances. This helped illuminate the relationship
    between the .kt code, and the xml stuff.

    Future Improvements: If you had more time, what might you add to this app? How would you enhance its functionality?
    
    Hmm, Im not sure. I might not make an app like this personally. Maybe I would add some custom
    art to make it look more official.
